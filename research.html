                I launched two CS workshops for young girls in fourth and fifth
                grade as part of a larger Girl Scouts of America initiative.
                These workshops embrace playfulness as a fundamental design
                constraint to ensure an early positive association with STEM
                concepts. Students are exposed to basic coding skills through
                simple robots that are programmed to play games. Survey results
                show that these workshops lead to a stronger interest in CS for
                the participants.

              <p>
                Growing interest in CS has led to a shortage of qualified
                educators for K-12 level instruction. Many out-of-school-time
                computing programs are led by well-intentioned individuals with
                little formal training in education such as undergraduate
                students pursuing computing degrees. This results in
                environments that are often not conducive to learning for
                students coming from diverse cultural and educational
                backgrounds. I addressed some of these challenges by using
                undergraduates as coaches in K-12 outreach CS activities for
                underrepresented students. These coaches are given essential
                pedagogical training with playful material that allows them to
                succeed as educators.

              <p>
                I developed two mobile station placement algorithms to meet the
                critical communication requirements of first responders in an ad
                hoc public safety network. By considering the class of first
                responders and user equipment applications, I provide an
                efficient base station placement algorithm to maximize critical
                communication needs according to priority levels.

                I defined different classes of mobile base stations that have
                varying performance characteristics and devised three different
                first responders mobility models. My proposed algorithm applies
                the modern clustering technique to deal with the characteristics
                of different kinds of mobile base stations.

                I generated two channel assignment algorithms (centralized and
                distributed) with considering switching overhead. Switching
                overhead is a major factor that limits overall network
                throughput in dynamic channel assignment schemes. I extended
                existing algorithms, Greedy Maximal Scheduling and Distributed
                Maximal Scheduling, taking the switching delay into account in
                the channel assignment.

              <strong>RL-based Queue Management for QoS Support </strong>
              <p>
                I developed a RL based queue management scheme that supports QoS
                in multi-radio multichannel wireless mesh networks. I developed
                an algorithm that takes into account differentiated queue
                management and channel assignment together. I used the technique
                of RL for the important step of assigning packet to one of the
                queues.

            Transmission of Patient Data in Wireless Hospital Networks

              <p>
                By applying reinforcement learning (RL)-based queue management
                and scheduling methods, I designed an intelligent patient data
                transmission scheme in Wireless Hospital Networks. In this
                scheme, I used a game-theoretical approach where patients
                compete for transmission resources by assigning different
                utility values to data packets. These utility functions are
                largely based on data criticality and deadline, which together
                determine the dataâ€™s scheduling priority.

                I created a QoS-aware policy-driven scheduling algorithm in

                while maximizing total utility in a multiuser system where
                multiple users can be scheduled during each interval. I
                developed a knapsack-like greedy algorithm to the utility
                maximizing problem and proved that the total utility under the
                algorithm converges to the maximum.
