                I launched two CS workshops for young girls in fourth and fifth
                grade as part of a larger Girl Scouts of America initiative.
                These workshops embrace playfulness as a fundamental design
                constraint to ensure an early positive association with STEM
                concepts. Students are exposed to basic coding skills through
                simple robots that are programmed to play games. Survey results
                show that these workshops lead to a stronger interest in CS for
                the participants.

                Growing interest in CS has led to a shortage of qualified
                educators for K-12 level instruction. Many out-of-school-time
                computing programs are led by well-intentioned individuals with
                little formal training in education such as undergraduate
                students pursuing computing degrees. This results in
                environments that are often not conducive to learning for
                students coming from diverse cultural and educational
                backgrounds. I addressed some of these challenges by using
                undergraduates as coaches in K-12 outreach CS activities for
                underrepresented students. These coaches are given essential
                pedagogical training with playful material that allows them to
                succeed as educators.

            Mobile Base Station Placement in Public Safety Networks

              <p>
                I developed two mobile station placement algorithms to meet the
                critical communication requirements of first responders in an ad
                hoc public safety network. By considering the class of first
                responders and user equipment applications, I provide an
                efficient base station placement algorithm to maximize critical
                communication needs according to priority levels.

              <p>
                I defined different classes of mobile base stations that have
                varying performance characteristics and devised three different
                first responders mobility models. My proposed algorithm applies
                the modern clustering technique to deal with the characteristics
                of different kinds of mobile base stations.
